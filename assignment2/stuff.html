        <h2>Expedition to Africa</h2>
        <p>
          The famous chocolatier Willy Wonka set off to Africa in search of rare ingredients.
          His goal was bold and daring: to find the perfect cocoa beans he had heard about in legends
          told by traders and old travel journals. In the jungle, he heard strange songs and saw
          a small people — the Oompa-Loompas, skillfully gathering cocoa among vines and thorns.

        <h2>The First Encounter</h2>
        <p>
          At first, the Oompa-Loompas were wary of Wonka: they guarded their groves and secrets.
          But when Wonka showed them how to roast the beans at the exact temperature to unlock
          their aroma, and offered them warm, thick chocolate, the ice melted. Their chief recognized
          in him a master who treated cocoa with the same reverence as they did.

        <h2>Wonka’s Proposal</h2>
        <p>
          The jungle was dangerous: wild animals stole their supplies, and sudden rains destroyed
          harvests. Wonka invited the Oompa-Loompas to move to his factory — a safe place where
          cocoa beans would never run out, and their knowledge would become the heart of the world’s
          finest recipes. In return, he promised them a home, work they would enjoy, and respect for
          their traditions.

        <h2>Journey to the Factory</h2>
        <p>
          The journey was long: caravans, trains, steamships. Wonka took care of provisions, and the
          Oompa-Loompas sang all the way — it made it easier to keep pace and morale. When they first
          saw the factory, with its pipes and transparent chocolate rivers, many could not believe
          it was real.

        <h2>New Roles and Crafts</h2>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li><strong>Bean Selectors:</strong> sorting cocoa by aroma and richness.</li>
          <li><strong>Roasters:</strong> watching temperature curves — a second decides the taste.</li>
          <li><strong>Texture Testers:</strong> checking the smoothness of bars and fillings, refining recipes.</li>
          <li><strong>Song Instructors:</strong> singing safety rules and discipline in the workshops.</li>
        </ul>

      <article class="story-card">
        <h2>What They Love</h2>
        <p>
          The Oompa-Loompas love cocoa beans and hot chocolate most of all — it is their culture and
          their celebration. They enjoy teamwork, musical breaks, and sugar-paste chess games.
          They respect strong flavors: each spice is like a note in a symphony.

      <article class="story-card">
        <h2>Songs and Morals</h2>
        <p>
          Since then, their songs have filled the factory: cheerful verses reminding children and
          adults alike that greed and rudeness lead to trouble, while curiosity and effort lead to
          discoveries and sweet rewards.

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Today, the Oompa-Loompas are the soul of Wonka’s factory. Their precision, rhythm, and
          love of cocoa have become part of its trademark style. And if you listen closely, amid the
          hum of machines, you can always hear them quietly singing about how one meeting changed
          many lives forever.
